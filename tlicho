Hello! 

My name is Alex and I am currently a master's student at UC Berkeley in California, United States studying computer science with an emphasis in education.

A friend of mine and I were planning on trying to visit Yellowknife, NT during our winter break in January. Out of personal interest, I was curious what local languages are spoken in the area and eventually landed on your language  Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì and subsequently this website. 

From the links on the left of this website, I see you developed an iOS app back in 2012. I personally do not own an iPhone; however, I do own an android phone and would be interested in trying to potentially help develop an app for android devices if it doesn't already exist! I would also be interested in helping with this website if there are any needs that I could also be of help with.

I have some free time on the side and would love to possibly use any skills I have to help people learn this amazing language. The most recent date mentioned on this website is 2012 so hopefully this message will reach someone (I'll probably try to reach out in some other way as well).

Best,
Alex
